========

*Recreational Warfare .rs*

A top-down vehicle shooter based on an old Windows game called RecWar.

TODO screenshot - clicking opens game?
TODO github description, tags

note to self:
    - fix npm
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo/24404451#24404451
        - prefix path or it uses old debian npm which breaks everything
    - build with `wasm-pack build --target web` or it gives a mime type error

The Original Game
-----------------

Windows .exe only but runs ok-ish wine (sometimes freezes on map load). Includes a map editor.

homepage: http://recreationalwarfare.atspace.com/index_willem.html (the game's download is broken but still hosts extra maps)
unofficial homepage: http://www.recwar.50webs.com/
archive.org download: https://archive.org/details/recwar_201903
archive.org download with extra maps: https://archive.org/details/RecWar

The binaries in both archive.org links are identical to what i got on an old CD so should be safe.
