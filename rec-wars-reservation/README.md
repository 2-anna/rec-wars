RecWars is a free and open source clone of [RecWar](#the-original-game) - you control a vehicle and fight other vehicles in a variety of game modes using an arsenal of several distinct weapons. You can play against bots, in splitscreen and over the network.

**This package is a placeholder for the planned native client. See the [repository](https://github.com/martin-t/rec-wars) for more information and progress.**
