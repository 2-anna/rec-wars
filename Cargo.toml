# Optimize deps but not the rec-wars crate itself (tip from macroquad).
# This seems to slightly improve performance (judging by update avg/max times)
# and shouldn't meaningfully increase incremental compile times because deps only change rarely.

[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.profiling]
# Rustc optimizations (which make a huge difference) are still enabled but no additional wasm-opt
# Debug symbols are enabled
wasm-opt = false  # see wasm-opt note

[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]
# All possible optimizations
# No debug symbols (panic messages have line number but stack staces are without function names)
wasm-opt = ["-O3", "--enable-mutable-globals"]  # see wasm-opt note

# wasm-opt note:
# Commit bcf475e5fb (cargo update) causes wasm-opt to fail
# (though the compile itself succeeds and the result seems usable, just without these optimizaions).
# --enable-mutable-globals is a workaround but it seems wasm-opt doesn't help perf that much
# while somewhat slowing down compiling.
